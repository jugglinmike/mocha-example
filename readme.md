# Automating Tests with Mocha

An example project demonstrating how to write and run JavaScript unit tests.
Built using the following tools:

- [Mocha](http://mochajs.org/) for unit test structuring
- [Chai](http://chaijs.com/) for assertions
- [mocha-phantomjs](http://metaskills.net/mocha-phantomjs/) for supporting test
  execution from the command line (using [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/) for
  headless browser execution)

## Running the Tests

After downloading the source and installing the dependencies with `npm
install`, the tests can be run in either of two ways:

- Opening the `test/index.html` file in a web browser
- Running `npm test` from a terminal
